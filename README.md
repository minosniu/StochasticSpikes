Code based on my work with Dr. Atiyeh Ghoreyshi and Prof. Terry Sanger during my PhD studies at USC

I'm working on making the code run on Mac OS X. For now (if you happen to get a window) press 'm'.

## Linux

To run on linux, OpenGL libraries must be installed as well as GLUT libraries. I have tested this using freeglut. To install it run the following:

>> sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev
